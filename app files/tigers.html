                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>The tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) is a large cat and a member of the genus <i>Panthera</i> native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</p>
                    <p>The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates (large, hooved mammals), which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex</p> 
                    <p>Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</p>
                    <p>Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is legally protected in all range countries</p>
                    <p><strong>  WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM? </strong></p>
                    <p>The tiger habitat can be found, north of the Monkey trail</p>
